Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing any kind of text very efficient. It is included as "vi" with most UNIX systems and with Apple OS X. Vim is rock stable and is continuously being developed to become even better.

## Basic commands

`i` - enter "insert" (editing) mode

`esc` - return to "command" mode

`:wq` or `:x` or `ZZ` - write (save) and quit

`:q` - quit (fails if there are unsaved changes)

`:q!` or `ZQ` - force quit, discarding any changes

`h` - move cursor left, `j` - down, `k` - up, `l` - right

`H` - move to top of screen, `M` - to middle, `L` - to bottom

`0` - jump to the start of the line, `$` - to the end

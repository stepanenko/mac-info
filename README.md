## PATH Variable in macOS

- PATH is an essential environment variable that decides how programs and commands work on macOS
- Setting the PATH variable for a program or script allows you to run it from anywhere on the file system without specifying its absolute path
- Depending on your usage requirements, you can either set the PATH environment variable temporarily or permanently via the terminal
